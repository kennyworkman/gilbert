## The Anatomical Tradition

### Questions 

- differentiation: how cells become different?
- morphogenesis: how is development precisely ordered?
- growth: when to start and stop dividing?
- reproduction: how do you make the cells that produce an entire organism?
- evolution: what changes are possible given constraints of heritage?
- environment: how do organisms integrate context from around them into development?

### Anatomical Approaches

- comparative embryology: between organisms
- evolutionary embryology: ancestry constrains types of development
- teratology: use birth defects to understand what is important
- mathematical modeling: use equations to predict

### Evolutionary Embryology

How did "looking at embryos" help classify mysterious organisms?

- *Lancelet*: primitive "fish-like" chordate that diverged during Cambrian period
- *Tunicate*: immobile chordate (sea squirts)

Thompson - larval barnacles identical to larval crabs: barnacles are arthropods not mollusks
Kowalevsky - Tunicate larvae have notochords + form neural tubes similar to amphioxus: therefore chordates and not mollusks.

Phylum Chordata:
- Subphylum Vertebrata
- Subphylum Cephalochordata (amphioxus, lancelets)
- Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates)

What characterizes chordata members:

- notochord (flexible rod of cells NOT vertebrae)
- dorsal hollow nerve chord (DNHC)
- pharyngeal 
- post anal tail

*DNHC*: emerges from ectoderm, strip thickens (neural plate) and folds inwards to form tube
*notochord*: forms from mesoderm, lies between DNHC and gut tube, acts as signaling center during development
*pharyngeal slits* openings in throat area of the embryo
*tail*: hmm

von Baer's laws: the more related an organism is, the later in its development
the differences will appear.

### Embryonic Homologies

Homology between gill support in jawless fish and vertebrate jaw.

Evidence for homology between gill support cartilage and vertebrate jaw:

1/ Bones derived from neural crest layer (almost all other come from mesoderm)
2/ Upper and lower portions with a hinge
3/ Support muscles seem homologous

Now look at progression of 1st and 2nd embryonic (pharyngeal) arches:

2/ Becomes *hyomandibular bone* (brace) that links jaw to cranium. Early vertebrates
repurposed bone as good medium to transduce sound. As jaw fused to cranium, the
linking function became unnecessary and the sound transduction function became
primary. *Hyomandibular bone* -> *stapes bone*

1/ Becomes jaw element. The posterior pieces are responsible for
articulation. Mammals developed articulation in another spot (), so these detached and formed two additional inner ear bones: *incus* and *malleus* bones. This is unique to mammals and
lower vertebrates only have the ear bone derived from (2).

#### Primer on Embryonic Arches

In week 4 of human development, small bulges separated by clefts that are
responsible for certain structures.

1/ Mandibular (jaw and incus/malleus in humans) Meckel's cartilage
2/ Hyoid (staples in humans) Reichert's cartilage
3,4,6 / Laryngeal (swallowing, breathing)
5 has no function

They all share basic structure and plan:

1/ Ectoderm: skin
2/ Mesoderm: cranial nerve, aortic-arch arteries + cartilage thread through
here
3/ Endoderm: gut

The temporary cartilaginous (eg. Meckel's) guide development and then mostly go away
