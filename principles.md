## The Anatomical Tradition

### Questions 

- differentiation: how cells become different?
- morphogenesis: how is development precisely ordered?
- growth: when to start and stop dividing?
- reproduction: how do you make the cells that produce an entire organism?
- evolution: what changes are possible given constraints of heritage?
- environment: how do organisms integrate context from around them into development?

### Anatomical Approaches

- comparative embryology: between organisms
- evolutionary embryology: ancestry constrains types of development
- teratology: use birth defects to understand what is important
- mathematical modeling: use equations to predict

### Evolutionary Embryology

How did "looking at embryos" help classify mysterious organisms?

- *Lancelet*: primitive "fish-like" chordate that diverged during Cambrian period
- *Tunicate*: immobile chordate (sea squirts)

Thompson - larval barnacles identical to larval crabs: barnacles are arthropods not mollusks
Kowalevsky - Tunicate larvae have notochords + form neural tubes similar to amphioxus: therefore chordates and not mollusks.

Phylum Chordata:
- Subphylum Vertebrata
- Subphylum Cephalochordata (amphioxus, lancelets)
- Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates)

What characterizes chordata members:

- notochord (flexible rod of cells NOT vertebrae)
- dorsal hollow nerve chord (DNHC)
- pharyngeal 
- post anal tail

*DNHC*: emerges from ectoderm, strip thickens (neural plate) and folds inwards to form tube
*notochord*: forms from mesoderm, lies between DNHC and gut tube, acts as signaling center during development
*pharyngeal slits* openings in throat area of the embryo
*tail*: hmm

von Baer's laws: the more related an organism is, the later in its development
the differences will appear.
